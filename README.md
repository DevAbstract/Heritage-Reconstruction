# Heritage-Reconstruction project

### Runs a diffusion model to reconstruct the user input architecture/artefact according to the mask.
### (Mask for now needs to be generated manually by the user)
### NOTE: Make sure you are in sd-inpainting directory when running infer_sd.py to avoid path conflicts!
